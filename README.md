# Word Vector Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook `word-vector-visualization.ipynb` that demonstrates how to visualize word vectors using PCA and t-SNE.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Packages listed in `requirements.txt`  

## Usage

1. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook word-vector-visualization.ipynb`

The notebook loads pre-trained GloVe word vectors and projects them into 2D space using PCA and t-SNE for visualization. It also shows how to find closest words to a given word based on cosine similarity of their vectors.## Word Vector Visualization
